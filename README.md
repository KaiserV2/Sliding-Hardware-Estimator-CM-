# Sliding-Hardware-Estimator-CM-


S.H.E.: a generic framework used to conduct statistics of data stream over a sliding window (e.g. the past 1 second).

This repostory contains the SHE-CMsketch of the manuscript submitted to SIGKDD'20.

SHE-CMsketch is used to conduct frequency measurement of items (e.g. datagrams with the same source/destination IP/Port) in a network data stream. 

BOBHash is used as the hash function in the code.

Due to the file size limitation in Github, we cannot upload all of our used datasets. Please download the CAIDA dataset from https://www.caida.org/data/.
